    <h1>Leonhard Euler (1707-1783)</h1>
    <p>The greatest mathematician of the eighteenh century. <stong>Leonhard Euler</stong> was born in Basel, Switzerland. There he studied under another giant
    of mathematics, <strong>Jean Bernoulli</strong>. In 1731 Euler became a professor of physics and mathematics at St.Petersburg Academy of Siences. Euler was the most prolific mathematician of all tim, publishing over 800 different books and papers. 
    His influence was felt in physics and astronomy as well. Euler's work on mathematical analysis, <em>Introduction in analysin infiniorum</em> (1748) remained a standard textbook for well over a cenrury. For the princess of Anhalt-Dessau he wrote 
    <em>Lettres a une princesse d'Allemagne</em> (1768-1772), giving a clear non-technical outline of the main physical theories of the time. </p>
    <p>One can hardly do math without copying Euler. Notations still in use today, such as e and pi, were introduced in Euler's writings. He is pehaps best known for his reserch into mathematical analysis. Euler's formula </p>
    <p>cos(x) + isin(x) = e<sup>ix</sup></p>
    <p>demonstates the relationship between algebra, complex analysis, and trigononetry. From this equation, it's easy to derive the equation</p>
    <p>e<sup>(∏<em>t</em>)</sup> + 1 =0</p>
    <p>which relates the fundamental constatus: 0.1, ∏, e, and i in a single beutiful and elegant statenent.</p>
    <p>Leonhard Euler died in 1783, leaving behind a legacy perhaps unmatched, and certainly unsupassed, in the annals of mathematics.</p>
